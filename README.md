# Database-Project - For Preschool
Creating a database for a Preschool using MySQL, Python and Flask.

The Web-App folder is so we can display data from the database onto the website.

Test.py is so you can do a test query on the data in test.sql.

Copy all of the code from the Schooldb file and paste it in a query and execute.
